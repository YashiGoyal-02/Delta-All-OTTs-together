# DeltaWebsite
Delta aims to help the user to decide a movie to watch by recommending the genre and a list of some movies for reference based on the user's mood detected by capturing their face. Apart from this, it also aims to bring all the popular OTT's to one platform so that the user can access the OTTs from one place only and achieve a hazzle-free login . Future Work for this project includes that we can collaborate with the OTTs so that the user doesn't have to buy the subscription of the platforms separately, the user can buy only one Delta subscription and enjoy all the OTTs. Also, while capturing the face, the API can also predict the age of the user so that if the user is below 18 years, we can remove all the 18+ recommendations.
